1. Methodology document: Contains an overview of some of the key indicators along with its current/existing methodology and the new methodology (which still needs to be finalized). For now, you can focus on the existing methodology which explains how the aggregate/regional/global number is being derived using the individual country figures (mostly, weighted mean, weighted geometric mean, etc.). 

2. The excel file contains the Data-A tab, which is our final published data tab, and the IV tab (for the IV aggregate - Big four) which contains the workings of all the aggregate indicators. You would need to focus on the IV tab and as mentioned in our call yesterday, we use a certain customized function built in excel to derive the aggregate numbers, however, for each different type of customized function, I have also calculated the aggregate figure using a simple excel function (in the tab IV 2) so you can understand how the numbers are derived, along with the methodology doc which explains the same for key variables. The examples (simple excel formulas) are for only a few certain indicators, as the same logic will apply to others, just that the data ranges and weights may differ from indicator to indicator. 

In the IV tab, for each indicator, for example, Nominal GDP PPP, the individual country data is flowing in (from our publish database) Rows 5-8, and then the aggregate Nominal GDP PPP is being derived in Row 9 using the customized function. The same applies for other indicators.
3. I am also creating a doc with each indicator, their custom function and their generic derivation which you can refer to, but in the meantime you can start looking into the excel file and the methodology document. Will share the doc once completed.
